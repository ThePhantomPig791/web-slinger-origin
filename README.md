## **Web Slinger** 
Impact: :yellow_circle::yellow_circle:

:green_circle:__Agility__
> The more you move, the faster you'll go. You also take less fall damage.
> *(After 3 seconds of moving, you will get speed and jump boost, and the level of each will go up with each second you move. Caps at level 10.)*
> *(You take 80% less fall damage, being able to sustain just over an 100 block fall with half a heart left.)*

:red_circle:__Waterlogged__
> Getting your web shooters wet will temporarily disable them.
> *(Being in water will disable them for 15 seconds, while being in rain will only disable them for 3.)*
:green_circle:__Webbing__

> You have 6 different types of webbing available to your disposable, half of them needing a special upgrade for your web shooters.
> *(You can open your web selection menu with [Secondary].)*
> *(You can also use the save and load hotbar keys to cycle through the web types.)*

`Latch Web`
> A very stretchy web type, the Latch web can either open doors from a distance or pull mobs with incredible force! Don't worry about flinging your friends to their demise, though, as the leftover web will almost guarantee a slow fall.
> *(Shoot a Latch web with [Primary].)*

`Spider Web`
> This versatile web type can be used for anything real spiders use their webs for! You can swing to get from point A to point B quickly, or you can create a line of thick web that traps your foes inside of it!
> *(Initiate a web swing with [Primary]. Hold the Use key to hold the webs, and let go of it to stop swinging. You can shoot up to 6 spider webs at a time.)*
> *(Create a web line by shooting exactly two spider webs and pressing the Attack key.)*

`Web Bullet`
> This small and quick-moving web will harm, blind, and slow any mob it hits!
> *(Shoot a Web Bullet with [Primary].)*

:yellow_circle:__Upgrades__
> The next three web types each require unique upgrades to be used.
> *(Web Grenade: Right click with five TNT in each hand, applying them on your web shooters.)*
> *(Poison Web: Right click with a pufferfish in your mainhand and a poison potion in your offhand to apply them on your web shooters.)*
> *(Electric Web: Right click with a beacon in your mainhand and a lightning rod in your offhand to apply them on your web shooters.)*

`Web Grenade`
> This web type will fire a gravity-affected projectile which explodes into a cloud of webs upon hitting something.
> *(Shoot a Web Grenade with [Primary].)*

`Poison Web`
> A more powerful variant of the Web Bullet that inflicts poison on hit.
> *(Shoot a Poison Web with [Primary].)*

`Electric Web`
> This webbing type is possibly the most powerful of all, as it lets you continuously electrocute something as long at you can keep looking at it. As you would guess, it'll also let you electrify a pool of water, frying anything swimming in it.
> *(Shoot an initial electric web with [Primary]. Hold down the Use key to continuously electrify it, as long as it's attached to a mob.)*
> *(Releasing the Use key, ceasing to look directly at the mob, or having a block get in the way will all disconnect an electric web from its target.)*
> *(Shooting an electric web at the ground will cause a super small electrical overflow, lighting the ground on fire, but shooting it into water will deal five hearts to anything in water within 24 blocks.)*

:green_circle:__Sticky Limbs__
> You can climb up walls or across ceilings.
> *(Toggle with [SpectatorOutlines].)*

:yellow_circle:__Spider Strength__
> You naturally punch harder and take less damage, but you'll deal 90% less damage with any tool or weapon.
> *(Toggle the extra damage/resistance with [SpectatorOutlines].)*

:red_circle:__Special Restrictions__
> Any armor better than leather will slow you down too much, even to the point where you won't wear it.

:red_circle:__Flammable__
> Hot things cause your backup webs to burst into flames, making you take triple fire, lava, and magma damage.
